## Personal Projects

### Speed Champion
URL: karts.tiago-coutinho.com
GitHub: github.com/COU7INHO/karst-app-backend (backend), github.com/COU7INHO/speedway-stats (frontend)
Status: Live, self-hosted

Speed Champion is a karting lap time tracking app built for a group of friends. It uses OCR powered by Mistral to automatically read race classification sheets, removing the need to enter data manually. It tracks performance over time, allows head-to-head comparisons between drivers, and has a mobile-friendly interface for use at the track. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, the backend with Django and Django REST Framework, data is stored in PostgreSQL, and the whole thing runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 behind Nginx.
